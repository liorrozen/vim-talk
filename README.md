- Technical Limitations

A little while ago (roughly 40 years), the way people used computers was slightly
different from what we see today. Technical limitations were a large aspect of this
and a good example of one of these limitations was graphical displays (and the resources
needed to utilize them).

- Computing back then...

We're talking about an era in which there was one central mainframe computer
and users interacted with the mainframe through terminals.  This was basically
a keyboard connected to a printer. Teleprinters, TeleTypewriter, TeleType.

What is TTY? in a linux/unix context?

Home computers would come with "line editors" that bypassed
the need for memory intensive full screen text editing. 
Typing, editing and document displaying don't happen at the same time.
Commands are given to modify the document (usually line-by-line) and in order
to display a part of the document you would have to give a different command.

vi - Originated in the early 70's
It was baically a VISUAL mode for the unix ex editor (a line based editor).
