# Accessing the shell

The `!` character on the command line essentially releases the rest of the command to the shell
after some basic substitutiions.

- `%` Current file name.
- `%:p:h` Folder name of current file.

## Pipe current buffer to shell command (file doesnâ€™t exist yet):
`:w !grep search-term`

## Read output of command into buffer:
`:r !curl icanhazip.com`

## Pipe current buffer contents to shell command and override range of lines in current buffer with output:
`:% !grep -c meta`

## Execute shell command with :!command %
`:!bundle exec ruby %` Execute current file.

## View output of last commands without leaving vim:
`:!`
